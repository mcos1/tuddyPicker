I initially wanted to build this app to lose less money on sundays (probably would have lost more) but I couldn't find a free api that offers the in depth data I wanted and the only other option was to go through all the data over the first 8 weeks of the nfl and make my own spreadsheets. Instead chatgpt generated some mock data for me and I used that. Hopefully next season or the one after that there will be something that offers all the data I need to make this app successful.
